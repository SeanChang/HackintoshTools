Official hardware support for macOS Sonoma (macOS 14) is notably more limited than its predecessor, macOS Ventura (macOS 13), and some features only work on proper Macs with recent Apple Silicon processors. There also are many reported issues with third-party Wi-Fi hardware in particular; be sure to verify specific hardware compatibility before upgrading an older Hackintosh to this version of the macOS or buying components for a new one.
